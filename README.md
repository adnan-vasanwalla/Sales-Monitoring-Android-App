# Sales-Monitoring-Android-App
The functionality of this application was to enable sales managers to manage all the required information about their sales team, i.e., assign locations on maps for different salespersons from where they can sell their products, the minimum amount of sales that should be done from that location and profile managements of their team. Salespersons on the other hand, after doing sales from a particular location, can enter the worth of sales done. The sales manager and sales client are two different android applications.  

Tools and Technologies Used: Android Studio, Google Maps and MySQL server.
